/*
 * Use Cramer's rule to solve the following 2 X 2 system of linear equations for
 * x and y:
 * ax + by = e x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc)
 * cx + dy = f y = (af - ec)/(ad -bc)
 * Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter the constants a, b, c, d,
 * e, and f and the display the solution (x =?? and y =??). If ad-bc is 0, then
 * your program prints â€œThe equation has no solution".
 * Note: (1) 3.4x+50.2y=44.5 (2) 2.1x+.55y=5.9
